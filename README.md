# DynaVac: Modeling the Evolution of Immunogenicity Dynamics Provides Insight into SARS-CoV-2 Immunization Strategies

## Project Description

DynaVac is an innovative computational model developed to quantitatively describe and predict the immune response dynamics induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The model uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on advanced immunological mechanisms to abstract key cellular and molecular processes of antibody immune response, including mRNA translation to produce antigens, naive B-cell affinity maturation, differentiation of memory B cells and plasma cells, as well as antigen-antibody neutralization. The model also accounts for the activation, proliferation, competition, and differentiation of memory B cells generated during primary immunization when reactivated in booster immunizations.

Specifically, the equations describe the dynamic changes of key components such as antigens ($Ag$), naïve B cells ($N$), memory B cells ($M_{on}, M_{off}$), and antibodies ($Ab$). The general form of the equations is as follows:
```math
\begin{gather}
\frac{dAg_i}{dt} = -\sum_{j}^{n} \gamma_{\text{neu}_i} c_{i,j}  Ag_i  Ab_j - \gamma_{\text{Ag}}  Ag_i \\
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = a_N(t) s_N \frac{Ag_i}{Ag_i + K} N_i (1-N_i) - d_N N_i \\
\frac{dM_{\text{off}_i}}{dt} = k_{N2M} N_i \left[ 1 - \sum_{j}^{n} (M_{\text{off}_j} + M_{\text{on}_j}) \right] - d_M M_{\text{off}_i} \\
\frac{dM_{\text{on}_i}}{dt} = a_M(t) s_M \left(\sum_{k}^{n} \frac{Ag_k}{Ag_k + K} \frac{c_{i,k} M_{\text{on}_i}}{\sum_{j}^{n}c_{j,k} M_{\text{on}_j} + m_0} \right) M_{\text{on}_i} \left[ 1 - \sum_{j}^{n} (M_{\text{off}_j} + M_{\text{on}_j}) \right] - d_M M_{\text{on}_i} \\
\frac{dAb_i}{dt} = a_N(t) p_N N_i + a_M(t) \frac{p_M M_{\text{on}_i} c_{i,k}}{c_{i,k} + c_0} - \gamma_{\text{neu}_i} \sum_{j}^{n} c_{j,i} Ag_j Ab_i - \gamma_{\text{Ab}} Ab_i
\end{gather}
```
The subscript $i$ represents the variant index. For detailed derivation of the equations and parameter meanings, please refer to the supplementary notes in the related publication [link to the paper](dynavac.cub.ynu.edu.cn).

By fitting pseudovirus titration experimental data from various vaccination combinations, DynaVac can comprehensively and quantitatively characterize and predict the humoral immune response dynamics induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during primary and booster immunizations. Our simulation results align with and expand upon the current understanding of immune imprinting. DynaVac provides a powerful quantitative tool for optimizing vaccine composition design and immunization strategies.

This repository includes the code to reproduce the main results of our related publication (Figures 3 to 6) and offers methods for simulating personalized vaccination strategies. For quick online interactive simulations, visit the [DynaVac Online Interface](https://dynavac.cub.ynu.edu.cn).

## Usage

### 1. Reproduction of Main Results

#### 1.2 Figure 4: Model Validation in Humans

To reproduce Figure 4:

It generates multiple simulation results by varying the antigenic distance and primary vaccination dosage. Users can modify fixed variables such as `vaccine_time` or `booster_dosage` to adjust the simulation scenario.

Users can modify fixed variables such as `vaccine_amount` to adjust the simulation scenario.


### 2. Personalized Vaccination Strategy Simulation

`Personalized_vac/main.m` enables simulation of the molecular and cellular dynamics under personalized vaccination strategies. Consider a simulation involving $n$ variants and $m$ consecutive vaccinations. The vaccination strategy can be described by four $m$-dimensional vectors: $T,V,D,P$, where:

- $T = [t_{01},t_{02} ,..., t_{0m}]$ with $0 ≤ t_{01} < t_{02} < ... < t_{0m}$, representing the time of the `k-th` vaccination in days.
- $V = [v_1 ,v_2 ,..., v_m]$ with $vk ∈ {1,2,...,6}$, representing the variant used in the `k-th` vaccination (`1: WT`, `2: Alpha/Beta`, `3: Delta`, `4: BA.1`, `5: BA.2/BA.5`, `6: XBB.1.5`).
- $D = [d_1 ,d_2 ,... ,d_m]$ with $d_k > 0$, representing the dosage of the `k-th` vaccination in μg.
- $P = [p_1 ,p_2, ... ,p_m]$ with $p_k ∈ {1,2,3}$, representing the vaccine type (`1: protein vaccine`, `2: mRNA vaccine`, `3: inactivated vaccine`).

For multivalent vaccines, extend the monovalent vaccine simulation method by replacing the `m`-dimensional vector $V$ with a $q×m$ matrix:

```math

V = \begin{pmatrix}
v_{1,1} & v_{1,2} & \dots & v_{1,m} \\
v_{2,1} & v_{2,2} & \dots & v_{2,m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{q,1} & v_{q,2} & \dots & v_{q,m}
\end{pmatrix}

```

Where $q$ represents the highest vaccine valency in the strategy, and $v_{jk} \in \{0,1,2,...,n\}$ represents the variant of the `j-th` antigenic component in the vaccine used in the `k-th` vaccination. If the valency of the vaccine used in the `k-th` vaccination is denoted as $q_k$ and is lower than the highest vaccine valency $q$, then $v_{j,k} = 0$ for all $j$ such that $q_k < j ≤ q$.

Running `main.m` generates area plots showing the dynamic changes in antigen, naïve B-cell maturity, memory B-cells, and antibody levels specific to each variant over time.

Users can customize the vaccination strategy for the 6 SARS-CoV-2 variants in `main.m` lines 13-18:

```matlab
% -----------personalized vaccination strategy---------
vaccine_variant = [1 4 3 2 5;
                   0 0 5 0 6]; % V: vaccination variant
% (1: WT, 2: Alpha/Beta, 3: Delta, 4: BA.1, 5: BA.2/BA.5, 6: XBB.1.5) 
vaccine_amount = [10 30 30 20 30]; % D: vaccination dosage
vaccine_time = [0 200 250 420 440]; % T: vaccination time (days)
vaccine_type = [2 2 2 2 2]; % P: vaccination type (1: protein, 2: mRNA, 3: inactivated)
```

(Ensure that the columns of the four input arrays are of the same length.)

The antigen-antibody cross-neutralization matrix for the six SARS-CoV-2 variants, derived from pseudovirus titration experiments in this study, does not require user customization.
